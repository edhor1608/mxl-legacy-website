### Git branching and commits

- Branch from `main`. Avoid direct pushes to `main`.
- Branch names: `feature/<short-desc>`, `fix/<short-desc>`, `chore/<short-desc>`.
- Conventional Commits for messages:
  - `feat: add HallOfFameWall animation`
  - `fix: correct canonical URL on gallery`
  - `chore: update dependencies`
- Keep commits focused and small. One logical change per commit.
