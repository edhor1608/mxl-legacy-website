### Code style and formatting

- Use TypeScript types/interfaces for props and data shapes.
- Prefer descriptive names (no 1â€“2 char vars). Keep functions small with guard clauses.
- Avoid inline comments for obvious code; document "why" above complex code.
- Run Prettier with `prettier-plugin-astro` and `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` before commits.
- Filenames: `PascalCase.astro` for components, `kebab-case.astro` for pages, `camelCase.ts` for helpers/data when needed.
- No client JS by default. If adding an island, colocate in `src/components` and clearly justify.
