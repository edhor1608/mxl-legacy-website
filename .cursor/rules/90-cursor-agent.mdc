### Cursor agent rules

- Read rules in `.cursor/rules` before proposing changes. Align with `SEO.astro` and `BaseLayout.astro`.
- Prefer edits that keep the site static and zeroâ€‘JS by default.
- When adding pages, use `BaseLayout.astro` and set page meta props.
- Centralize constants in `src/data/**`; do not hardcode site config across pages.
- Avoid `@astrojs/image` unless build issues are resolved; keep `<img loading="lazy">`.
- Ask for confirmation before changing content tone, brand colors, or URL slugs.
- When uncertain about German copy, ask the user for phrasing or provide two options.
- After edits: run build locally and suggest a Lighthouse check.
